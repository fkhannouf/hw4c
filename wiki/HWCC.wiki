#summary Hollywood Cubic Compliler.

= Introduction =

HWCC means Hollywood Cubic Compiler and is a graphical frontend for Hollywood's compiler in order to compile comfortably for multiple platforms simultaneously.

HWCC is part of hw4cubic package, but it is also possible to use it stand alone. It will be released as a separate download later.
