=0 Requirements=

You need to have an installed Cubic IDE and at least Hollywood 3.0 to use this add on. With version 1.1 hw4cubic automatically distinguishes between Hollywood 3 and Hollywood 4, as with Hollywood 4 you have additonal features!
It was created with AmiKit and OS 3.9, but should work on all platforms that can run Cubic IDE. But if you encounter problems on your platform write a mail to the address provided in the Legal Notice section or post a report in the hw4cubic-Thread at Amiga-Resistance.info: http://www.amig-resistance.info/phpbb33/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=1919

You can download hw4cubic here: http://www.amiga-resistance.info/phpbb33/downloads.php?view=detail&df_id=391

=1 General=
1.1: *syntax highlighting* for all Hollywood keywords and functions (depending on you Hollywood version); special labelling for obsolete Hollywood commands, so updating the source code to recommend Hollywood version should be much easier now

=2 Functions via toolbar=
2.1: insert template text of a minimalistic Hollywood programm for quick coding start


2.2: compile source code with separate tool "HWCC" (Hollywood-Cubic-Compiler), which is a GUI for compiling for different plattforms at once


2.3: directly compile versions for AmigaOS 3, AmigaOS 4, AROS, MacOS, MacOS Intel (V 1.1 - just with Hollywood 4), MorphOS, WarpOS, Windows and the Applet version (see screenshot 2.2)

2.4: Button to directly run the coded application (left button on screenshot)


2.5: Button to view the Hollywood documentation guide (second button from the right on screenshot 2.4)

2.6: Button to view the Hollywood tutorial code (right button on screenshot 2.4)

2.7: Button for quick insert of (hard to remember) constants for objects, attributes, coordinates, colors, transitions, fonts and fill styles


=3 Functions via keyboard=
3.1: pressing F1 while the cursor is over a Hollywood function or keyword displays the corresponding section in the Hollywood documentation guide (context sensitive help); if cursor is not over a word, the main topic of the help guide is displayed


3.2: pressing Shift+F1 while cursor is over a Hollywood function opens the corresponding section of the hollywood.guide in write protect mode within GoldED in a new document, so you can now easily copy examples etc. and paste it into your source code

3.3: pressing F2 compiles the source code to a choosen path and file as a programm for the platform you are working on

3.4: pressing Shift+F2 compiles the source code to a choosen path and file as an applet

3.5: pressing F4 directly runs the coded application in window mode (V 1.0), while Shift+F4 runs it in fullscreen mode. (V 1.1)

3.6: pressing F7 starts HWCC with given paths and file/application names (see screenshot 2.2)

3.7: pressing ESC after typing the beginning of a Hollywood function or keyword completes the word automatically

3.8: pressing Strg+Space after typing the beginning of a Hollywood function or keyword shows a list of all possible functions to insert at cursor position (intellisense)


3.9: pressing Shift+Space after typing in some text completes the word if it was already typed in before (standard Cubic feature)

3.10: several patterns can be typed it to insert complete text templates at cursor position for control structures and blocks
==>
The following patterns are supported:
 * If. ==> If-EndIf
 * Ifel. ==> If-Else-EndIf
 * Ifelif. ==> If-ElseIf-Else-EndIf
 * Whi. ==> While-Wend
 * For. ==> For-To-Next
 * Forst. ==> For-To-Step-Next
 * Rep. ==> Repeat-Until
 * Swi. ==> Switch-Case-Default-EndSwitch
 * Func. ==> Function-EndFunction
 * Blo. ==> Block-EndBlock

3.11: pressing Amiga+/ shows a list of all of your defined functions in your source code; clicking at a function will jump to its definition


3.12: pressing Ctrl+f while the cursor is over the call of a user defined function will jump to its definition

=4 Troubleshooting/FAQ=
Q: I use AmiKit and Hollywood 4. Nearly everytime I compile my source code AmiKit freezes and I have to reboot. What's the problem?
A: It isn't completely clear yet what causes the problem, but a workaround is to disable the tooltype "TOOLPRI" of the application "LimpidClock" (right click on "Limpid Clock" icon, choose "Information", scroll down and double click the entry "TOOLPRI", and save the settings)

Q: I already have an older version of hw4cubic installed. How can I update?
A: Just download the latest archive, unpack it and run the install script (choose "Install ...").
